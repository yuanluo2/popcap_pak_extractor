# popcap_pak_extractor
##### A tool written in C++ 17 to extract the files from the popcap's .pak file, I have tested it with Bejeweled 3, Bejeweled Twist and PVZ's .pak files.
##### No 3rd dependencies, just a single file.
##### A very big thanks to https://github.com/nathaniel-daniel/popcap-pak-rs , I came to realize the popcap's .pak file format through this project, but I'm not familiar with rust, so I wrote a one in C++ myself.
